Msc Bioinformatics IRP: Computational enrichment of ctDNA in peripheral T-cell lymphoma <br/> <br/>

Greetings. This is my repository for the BS7130 Independent Research Project. <br/>
In this project, I tried to analyse the fragmentation profiles of our PTCL specimens and compare them against healthy controls using existing cfDNA tools.  I also aimed at detecting somatic copy number alternations,and subsetting shorter fragment to enhance ctDNA detection.  To ensure reliable results are produced, different tools are explored and compared. <br/><br/>

Limited by the small number of samples, the preliminary data showed that ctDNA molecules in PTCL had shorter fragment sizes compared to normal cfDNA. Unique CNAs and somatic variants were revealed, but the findings might be independent of the ctDNA load.  Enrichment did not lead to significant differences. <br/><br/>
